As a Minigame I've tried to create sticky blocks, there are two extra scripts CollectedObjController, FirstPlayer and some lines have
been added to PlayerManager script. Unfortunately, I am having problems with the colliders and rigidbodies so the minigame does not work...

PS. Win panel works just fine, I've just placed "StageArea" at the end of the road which is the minigame.

:(
